        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the meat:</b> In a skillet, cook the ground pork and
                ground beef until browned. Add the onion and continue cooking
                until it becomes translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes,
                tomato sauce, half of the parsely, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons
                of salt, oregano, and sugar. Simmer for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the noodles:</b> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly
                salted water until they are al dente (8 to 10 minutes). While
                the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make the cheese layer:</b> In a lrge bowel, combine the
                cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley,
                remaining salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Assemble the lasagna:</b> Spread a small amount of sauce on
                the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place two layers of
                noodles on top of the sauce. Then, layer with half of the cheese
                mixture, half of the remaining sauce, and half of the mozzarella
                cheese. Repeat these layers once more with the remaining
                Ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bake the lasagna:</b> Cover the baking dish with aluminum
                foil and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. After this, remove the foil
                and continue baking for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until the
                cheese on top is golden brown.
            </li>
