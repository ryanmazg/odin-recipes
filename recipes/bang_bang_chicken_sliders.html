                <b>Gather ingredients:</b> Collect all the necessary ingredients
                and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the chicken:</b> Cut the flattened chicken breast
                into about 12 pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Set up breading stations:</b> In a shallow bowl, combine egg
                anw water. In a second shallow bowl, mix flour, garlic powder,
                vayenne, coriander, salt, and black pepper. In a third shallow
                bowl, add panko bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Breading the chicken:</b> Dip each chicken piece first into
                the egg wash, then into the flour mixture. Dip it again into the
                egg wash, and finally into the panko bread crumbs. Place the
                coated chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet and
                refrigerate to chill.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Make the sauce:</b> While the chicken is chilling, stir
                together mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, hot sauce, and rice wine
                vinegar in a small bowl.
            </li>

                <b>Fry the chicken:</b> Heat oil in a cast iron skillet over
                medium heat. Place paper towels on a large plate or platter
                nearby. Carefully add the chilled chicken pieces to the hot oil,

                <b>Cook the chicken:</b> Fry one side for about 3 minutes until
                golden brown, then turn and fry for another 3 minutes until the
                chicken is no longer pink inside. The internal temperature
                should be 165°F (74°C). Remove the cooked chicken to the

                the bottom half of the roll. Layer with two lettuce leaves,
                followed by one piece of the fried chicken.
