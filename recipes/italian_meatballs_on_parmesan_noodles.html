        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Baked Italian meatballs served over garlic Parmesan noodles. They're
            so good, and despite the long list of ingredients, most are
            seasonings, so they are not difficult to make.

            <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat the oven:</b> Set the oven to 425°F (225°C).</li>
            <li>
                <b>Combine dry ingredients:</b> In a bowl, mix together the
                breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, oregano, garlic, salt, black
                pepper, basil, and red pepper flakes with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Add wet ingredients and beef:</b> Stir in the egg, milk, and
                ¼ cup of beef broth. Then, add the ground beef and mix with a
                fork just until everything is combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Form the meatballs:</b> With wet hands, roll the meat mixture
                into medium-sized balls and place them in a large casserole
                dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Add broth and cheese:</b> Pour 1 cup of beef broth into the
                casserole dish, or enough to create a ¼ inch deep layer.
                Sprinkle the meatballs with Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bake the meatballs (first round):</b> Bake for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flip and bake again:</b> Turn the meatballs over and continue
                baking for about 15 minutes more, or until they are no longer
                pink in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the noodles:</b> While the meatballs are baking, bring a
                large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles and
                cook until they are tender with a bite, which takes about 10
                minutes. Drain the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Parmesan noodles:</b> Place the drained noodles
                in a bowl and immediately add the butter, garlic paste,
                Parmesan, olive oil, black pepper, and parsley. Stir everything
                to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Serve:</b> Remove the meatballs from the oven. To serve,
                spoon the prepared noodles onto a plate and top with the
                meatballs.
            </li>
            <li><b>Garnish:</b> Sprinkle wth more parsley before enjoying.</li>
